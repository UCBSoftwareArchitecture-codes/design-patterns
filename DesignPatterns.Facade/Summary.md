**Summary:**
The Facade design pattern is particularly used when a system is very complex or difficult to understand because the system has a large number of interdependent classes or its source code is unavailable. 

**When to use it?**
A simple interface is required to access to a complex system.

The abstractions and implementations of a subsystem are tightly coupled.

Need an entry point to each level of layered software.
